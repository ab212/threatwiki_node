How to use:
- Make sure you have an instance of mongodb running
- npm install -d
- node app.js
- Point your browser to http://localhost:3000
- In DEV mode you won't need to be authentified
- If you run the app in production mode, you will be asked to login with a Google Apps account with a @thesentinelproject.org google apps email, to run in Production mode: export NODE_ENV=production. It is recommended to use a different instance of the DB in production mode vs dev mode
