How to use (for all versions):
- Make sure you have an instance of mongodb running
- npm install -d
- node app.js
- Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Tested and supported only under Node.js 0.8.X

We try to keep the master branch as stable as possible so feel free to get the most recent version out of git to play with.
- If you want to login with the Google Apps authentication, you need a @thesentinelproject.org domain and also need to specify the NODE_ENV to production
	ie: export NODE_ENV=production
- To auto-login without using Google Apps authentication, specify the NODE_ENV to development
	ie: export NODE_ENV=development
